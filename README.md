# House-Price-Prediction-Web-App-Project
Project: Bangalore House Price Prediction Web Application

Description: Created a web application to predict house prices in Bangalore using a Logistic Regression machine learning model. The project involved importing and analyzing the dataset, preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and test sets, creating and training the model, and deploying it as a web application.

Key Contributions:

    Imported and analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and features.
    Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
    Split the dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) sets to evaluate the model.
    Created a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn to predict house prices.
    Trained the model on the training dataset and evaluated its performance on the test dataset.
    Deployed the model as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input house features and get price predictions.

Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Flask

Skills Demonstrated: Data preprocessing, machine learning model development, web application development, deployment
